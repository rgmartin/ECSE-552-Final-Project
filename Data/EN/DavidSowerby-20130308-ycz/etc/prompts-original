ar-07 One rainy day the rats heard a great noise in the loft. 
ar-08 The pine rafters were all rotten, so that the barn was rather unsafe. 
ar-09 At last the joists gave way and fell to the ground. 
ar-10 The walls shook, and all the rats' hair stood on end with fear and horror. 
ar-11 "This won't do," said the captain; "I'll send out scouts to search for a new home." 
ar-12 Within five hours the ten scouts came back and said, 
ar-13 We found a stone house where there is room for us all. 
ar-14 There is a kindly horse named Nelly, a cow, a calf, and a garden with an elm tree. 
ar-15 The rats crawled out of their little houses and stood on the floor in a long line. 
ar-16 Just then the old rat saw Arthur. Stop. he ordered coarsely.
