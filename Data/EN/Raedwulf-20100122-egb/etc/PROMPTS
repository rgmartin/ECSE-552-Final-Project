Raedwulf-20100122-egb/mfc/b0058 WE MUST ACHIEVE OUR OWN SALVATION
Raedwulf-20100122-egb/mfc/b0059 IN MOMENTS OF MENTAL ENERGY PHILIP WAS RESTLESS
Raedwulf-20100122-egb/mfc/b0060 HE WOULD KEEP HIS FAITH WITH GREGSON FOR THE PROMISED DAY OR TWO
Raedwulf-20100122-egb/mfc/b0061 SOMETHING ABOUT IT SEEMED TO FASCINATE HIM TO CHALLENGE HIS PRESENCE
Raedwulf-20100122-egb/mfc/b0062 NOW IT WAS MISSING FROM THE WALL
Raedwulf-20100122-egb/mfc/b0063 HE BOILED HIMSELF SOME COFFEE AND SAT DOWN TO WAIT
Raedwulf-20100122-egb/mfc/b0064 I'M GOING DOWN THERE WITH YOU AND I'M GOING TO FIGHT
Raedwulf-20100122-egb/mfc/b0065 NOW HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING TO SAY AGAINST ME MR PHILIP
Raedwulf-20100122-egb/mfc/b0066 IF I MEET HER AGAIN I SHALL APOLOGIZE SAID EILEEN
Raedwulf-20100122-egb/mfc/b0067 BELOW HIM THE SHADOW WAS BROKEN INTO A POOL OF RIPPLING STARLIGHT
