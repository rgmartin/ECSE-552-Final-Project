b0116 I have hunted along this ridge, replied Philip. 
b0117 That's Thorpe's, said the young engineer. 
b0118 We saw your light, and thought you wouldn't mind a call. 
b0119 Billinger may arrive in time. 
b0120 There's the hitch, replied Thorpe, rolling a cigarette. 
b0121 I want my men to work by themselves. 
b0122 Philip saw MacDougall soon after his short talk with Thorpe. 
b0123 Neither could they understand the growing disaffection among Thorpe's men. 
b0124 Two weeks passed, and in that time Thorpe left camp three times. 
b0125 It was the third or fourth time that Philip had heard MacDougall swear.
